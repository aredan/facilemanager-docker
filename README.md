facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the system administrator in mind. Say good-bye to manual management of services running on multiple servers.

# Docker

This is a containerized version of the facilManager web application.
You will need an external MySQL DB for storing the data.

Only the management is in this container, the agents need to be run on each server that you want to be managerd from this central administration.
